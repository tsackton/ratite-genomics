1. Goal was to determine if: a) each gene linked to an mCE candidate had genomic sequence in emu, b) if Liftover (from Chicken) and HOG assignments for droNov Maker transcripts were the same for our candidate mCE list
2. Files located at /n/home12/pgrayson/emu_primer_files
3. Used bed files from RNA liftover work to begin (droNov a3 and b)
4. module load bedtools2, then run intersect with -wo to give the emu maker ID and the ncbi chicken ID for each intersection on the same line in a large bed file (droNov_allout_bed12.txt)
5. Parse this allout file to get just the gene IDs together using bd_analyzer_wo.py (gives droNov_allout_bed12out.txt).  This provides Liftover associations for later.
6. Copy mCE numbers from the candidate list and create a file with one on each line (ceCans.txt)
7. Use convert_Ens_to_NCBI.py to parse out the associated ensembl and NCBI accession numbers for each candidate mCE.  Generates linkedCans.txt
8. Use emu_HOG_puller.py and linkedCans.txt to produce emuMakers_perChickenHOG.txt.  This file grabs each HOG associated with an mCE on the candidate list for chicken.  Then it writes out every droNov maker transcript associated with that HOG and assumes that each one could be a hit with the chicken NCBI accession number.
9. Use emu_chicken_HOGandLO_check.py with emuMakers_perChickenHOG.txt, linkedCans.txt and droNov_allout_bed12out.txt to generate the final file (emuHOG_crossChecked.txt).  This script check to see if an emu Maker transcript was found during LO and through HOG association (printed in that order in outfile).  Then it checks to see if they match.  It also links the NCBI accession back to ensembl for easier viewing with the original candidate list.  
10. The top candidate genes (where emu HOG and emu LO match) were copied into emu_first_run_with_gene_names.txt as "droNovMakerID"\t"GeneName".
11. The file from 10 was used as input to maker_transcript_grabber.py, which grabs fasta transcripts from droNov.genome.all.maker.transcripts.fasta and produces emu_transcripts_matches.txt with >droNovMakerID_GeneName for each gene
