1. Downloaded GFF files from NCBI and used GFF files from Maker run for our 10 genomes.
2. Ran GFF_CDS_parser.py on each GFF file on an interactive node with srun -p interact -pty --mem 2000 -t 0-1:00:00 /bin/bash
3. Ran Convert_GFF_to_BED.py on each file to convert them.
4. Ran for FILE in $(ls *.bed); do wc $FILE -l; done on each group of files (gff from GFF_CDS_parser.py and bed from Convert_GFF_to_BED.py) to see if line number were consistent. 
5. Ran an interactive job with  srun -p interact --pty --mem 1000 -t 0-1:00:00 /bin/bash.  Ran bedtools2 (module load bedtools2)
        Placed chicken liftover beds (genSpe.bed) into folder a3, placed RNAseq/maker beds (genSpe.bed) into folder b and ran this script from b:
	for FILE in $(ls *.bed); do bedtools intersect -split -a ../a3/${FILE} -b $FILE -c -s > ../bedtools_out/${FILE%%.*}_bed12.txt; done &
6. Ran bd_analyzer.py on local computer using: for FILE in $(ls *.txt); do python bd_analyzer.py $FILE; done #this provides the number of exons lifted over and the number of lifted over exons that intercept a gene model
7. Running R.
