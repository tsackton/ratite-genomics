This directory contains useful annotations on the chicken genome (galGal4).

All final BED files have been:
* converted to galGal4 coordinates if not already in that format
* converted to NCBI chromosome ids for ease of incorporation into the genome browser
* converted to BED format if not already in that format

Each directory contains a separate analysis, with the methods used stored in a readme in that directory.
