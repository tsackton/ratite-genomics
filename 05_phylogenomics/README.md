Phylogenomics
===============

We used several data types for phylogenetic inference. Each subdirectory contains code used to produce input data for a particular data type, along with a readme for that data.

The anc_state_volant directory contains code used to analyze the probability that particular internal nodes in palaeognaths were volant under different model assumptions.

The species_tree directory contains Newick files of inferred species trees.
