- this directory contains files generated by running great 3.0.0 on mm10 and hg19 liftovers of the gapmissing datasets (extended, original, and reduced).
- great 3.0.0 was run with Basal plus extension and default settings
- on the great webserver, under global controls, hg19 allowed export of "all shown data as .tsv"
- for the export of hg19 files, the following was changed from defaul:
	1. MSigDB Perturbation was not reported
	2. Top Rows/Table was set to 100
	3. Observed Gene Hits was set to 2
	4. Term Annotation Count (min) was set to 5
- for mm10, selecting export "all shown data as .tsv" did not prompt a save of data.  we were able to export "all data as .tsv" for mm10, which is why the mouse and human files are different
