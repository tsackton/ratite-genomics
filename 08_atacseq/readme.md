Subdirectories contain code and results from additional analysis using ATAC-seq peaks and CNEEs:

- RAR_nearest_genes:
contains code and data to calculate intersections between CNEEs, ATAC-seq peaks, and Chip-seq peaks

- transfac:
contains code and data to run TRANSFAC on a peaks/CNEEs

- mCE directories:
contain code and additional analysis on specific CNEEs, including TRANSFAC results

- mammal_intersect:
