Scripts and other material for the assembly and analysis of ratite genomes.

**Disclaimer:** Although we welcome re-use of these materials, except where noted the code
we are sharing here is specific to this project and to the Harvard compute cluster. 
Filenames and paths are often hard-coded in scripts, and software versions/dependencies are
often managed via calls to the Harvard Odyssey cluster Lmod system.


Organization of this repository
------------

Each directory contains the scripts for a particular analysis, along with a README describing
that analysis. In many cases logs and/or output files are also stored in a subdirectory 
under each analysis. Numbers refer to the sections of the methods in the accompanying manuscript.
